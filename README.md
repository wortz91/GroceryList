# GroceryList

This application is still functional if you download the apk and run it.

This application allows a user to keep track of their grocery items that they need to buy and basic information about the items by clicking the item. The user can also delete/add by clicking the aforementioned icons.

The database is stored remotely on a server that is still active. RESTful web services are in the PHP folder.
